The data includes key metrics such as volumes, gross sales discount, discounts, net sales, cost of goods sold, gross profit, distribution, warehousing, and full delivered margin, as well as key performance indicators (KPIs) like gross profit percentage and FDM percentage.

Problem Statement:
The analysis indicates that the company experienced a decline in its overall performance from 2015 to 2016, with decreases in volumes, net sales, gross profit, and key profitability metrics. This raises concerns about the company's financial health and the need to identify the root causes of the decline.

- Extracting data from columns with different data types
- Utilizing filtering and search options to focus on relevant information
- Handling data uniformity to ensure accurate analysis
- Calculating and interpreting variance and absolute variance

Conclusion and Recommendations:
The analysis indicates that the company experienced a significant decline in its overall performance from 2015 to 2016. The decreases in volumes, net sales, gross profit, and key profitability metrics suggest that the company may have faced increased competition or pricing pressure, leading to lower sales and margins.

To address this decline and improve the company's financial and sales performance, the following recommendations are proposed:

1. Explore strategies to increase sales and optimize costs:
   - Identify and implement initiatives to drive revenue growth, such as expanding into new markets, introducing new products, or enhancing customer engagement.

2. Enhance operational efficiency and identify areas for process improvements:
   - Analyze the company's operations and identify opportunities to streamline processes, reduce waste, and improve productivity.
   - Implement continuous improvement initiatives to drive operational excellence.

3. Closely monitor and analyze the key performance indicators (KPIs):
   - Regularly review and analyze the company's KPIs, such as gross profit percentage and FDM percentage, to identify trends and inform decision-making.
   - Use advanced analytics and data visualization techniques to gain deeper insights into the company's performance.

4. Investigate the root causes of the declines:
   - Conduct a comprehensive investigation to understand the underlying factors contributing to the decreases in volumes, net sales, and gross profit.

By implementing these recommendations and leveraging the insights gained from the advanced pivot table analysis, the company can work towards regaining its financial and sales performance, and positioning itself for long-term success.
